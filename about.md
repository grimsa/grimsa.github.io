### About this blog

We all want to work on code that is easy to understand and modify, has good structure and few bugs. Code that we are happy about and can be productive in.

However, in practice, it is hardly ever the case.

Part of the problem is that the software development profession does not have a solid foundation.
Some set of ideas and principles that are universally agreed upon, consistently applied in practice and taught to newcomers.
There is no such thing (yet) and I am in no position to establish it.

This blog is my humble attempt at sharing the ideas I consider essential for building software well.
